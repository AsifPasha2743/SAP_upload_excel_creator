POA Date: Is this same as filter date? System Date Today morning we do the previous day's right? if so today's date or yesterday's date


After mapping neeed further mapping: State, Item Code, Item Name etc.. ??

Empty fields everywhere: Item Description, Closure Remarks, NSTP Remarks, SPL Code, No Of Visits, POA

Data Mapping Needed Columns:
  - BP Code: Business Partener Code from SAP



Predefined Fields: 
  set(common_fields_mapping) - set(user_defined_fields): {'SC Entry', 'Store ID'}  # Are all others to to be automated? or all is automated? then why user_defined fields are there?

Priority: M (for ALL except ICICI, IDFC) | High [ICICI, IDFC]  # why two models Single letter or full word? Is this a mistake? Should 'High' be 'H'?

Store ID: placed after one empty line. does it mean that before Store ID there is one more field?

State: map first from input sheets then? short names? 2 letter Abbrev?

Fill NA: -- [SC Entry, Service Ticket Number] | empty (np.NaN)  # better if we follow one model



Questions:
  - What is the difference between 2 KOTAK master files ie., (29) & (JAN)?
  - How many inputs for KOTAK | AXIS |||.. ? One sheet each for ['KOTAK', 'AXIS', 'SBI', 'HDFC', 'ICICI', 'IDFC']?
  - Break-Fix sheet will be used across all Banks right? - filter by BANK --> fiter by Open Tickets ---> then aggregate?

Requests:
  - Please send other banks also for the same day or month
  - the data mappings


Aggregation Process Logic:
  Step 1 - Data filter: 
    - (Status == Pending) --> (Recvd Date == SELECTED_DATE) ['KOTAK', 'AXIS', 'SBI', 'HDFC', 'ICICI', 'IDFC']  # Date col same? Recvd Date in all?
    - (Bank == SELECTED BANK) --> (Ticket Status==Open) (Recvd Date <= SELECTED_DATE) ["Complaints Master"]  # Date col same? Recvd Date in all?
  Step 2 - Aggregate:
    - Column mapping
    - Data Mapping
