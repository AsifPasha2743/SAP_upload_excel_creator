# 2 concerns
# 1. only upload limit is 200mb each with stremalit 
# 2. Excel limit is 10lakhs rows for xlsx (for xls it is only 65k). Current files have size that is around 3 lakh rows
 # might need to pull change this to a database
 # if we change it now, it will be easy. but later this will be dfficult
# Some of the cells valu is "--", this has to be fixed to np.NaN

uploaded_acquirer vs selcted_acquirer
uploaded_acquirer is used to name dataframes and this is the main vairable
but selected_acquier is just for routing functions
eg. The uploaded_acquirer HDFC AGGR will be routed to use HDFC (selected_acquirer) funtions


# For IDFC, Segment column is not found. Need clarification on this as well

# NOTES ON MAPPING EXCEL FILE UPLOADS

KEY SHOULD BE DUPLICATED
IN ONE KEY VALUE A DIFFERENT set of keys will be there. There also no duplication of keys in the current set list
never change sheet names or column names
make sure that no sheet is missing while uploading (with exact sheet names and columns)
Always keep a working mapping excel file as backup. if something goes wrong, upload the backup excel and revert the changes. 
don't duplicate similar keys. which will reduce standaradization of the data
